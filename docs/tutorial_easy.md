## Modelsâ€™ Presentation

### Logistic Model
#### Mathematical Aspects
#### Data
   - *"When you have this type of data, it is relevant to use this model"*

### Joint Model
### Mixture Model
### Covariate Model

## Algorithms Presentation

### Fit
*Do we prefere to use the term "derive population parameters" (as in previous user guide) or "fit"?*
#### Prerequisites
   - List of necessary libraries and dependencies.
   - Data format and preprocessing steps.
   - Here: pay attention to number of visits, outliers, NaN, not enough patients, non monotonous progression, parameters don't converge, score don't progress. 
#### Running Task
   - How to run the fit algorithm.
   - Example commands and code snippets.
#### Output
   - What results to expect from the fitting process.
#### Setting Options (Different Models)
   - How to set specific options for different types of models.
   - Customizing parameters for logistic, joint, mixture, and covariate models.
### Personalize
