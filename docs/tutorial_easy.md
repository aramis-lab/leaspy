# Leaspy's tutorial
*NOTE:Title to change?*

## Modelsâ€™ Presentation

### i. Logistic Model
#### 1. Mathematical Aspects
#### 2. Data
   - *"When you have this type of data, it is relevant to use this model"*

### ii. Joint Model
### iii. Mixture Model
### iv. Covariate Model

## Algorithms Presentation

### i. Fit
*Do we prefere to use the term "derive population parameters" (as in previous user guide) or "fit"?*
#### 1. Prerequisites
   - List of necessary libraries and dependencies.
   - Data format and preprocessing steps.
   - Here: pay attention to number of visits, outliers, NaN, not enough patients, non monotonous progression, parameters don't converge, score don't progress. 
#### 2. Running Task
   - How to run the fit algorithm.
   - Example commands and code snippets.
#### 3. Output
   - What results to expect from the fitting process.
#### 4. Setting Options (Different Models)
   - How to set specific options for different types of models.
   - Customizing parameters for logistic, joint, mixture, and covariate models.
### ii. Personalize
### iii. Estimate
### iv. Simulate
 
## Model Selection and Evaluation

### i. Metrics (likelihood and others?)

## Visualization

### i. DataFrame
### ii. Plotting
### iii. Cofactor Analysis

## To Go Further

### i. Model Implementation
#### 1. DAG Intuition and Structure for Models

*NOTE: do we reallly need to separate Tuto 2 and 3?"*
