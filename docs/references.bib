abstract = {Nowadays there is an increased medical interest in personalized medicine and tailoring decision making to the needs of individual patients. Within this context our developments are motivated from a Dutch study at the Cardio-Thoracic Surgery Department of the Erasmus Medical Center, consisting of patients who received a human tissue valve in aortic position and who were thereafter monitored echocardiographically. Our aim is to utilize the available follow-up measurements of the current patients to produce dynamically updated predictions of both survival and freedom from re-intervention for future patients. In this paper, we propose to jointly model multiple longitudinal measurements combined with competing risk survival outcomes and derive the dynamically updated cumulative incidence functions. Moreover, we investigate whether different features of the longitudinal processes would change significantly the prediction for the events of interest by considering different types of association structures, such as time-dependent trajectory slopes and time-dependent cumulative effects. Our final contribution focuses on optimizing the quality of the derived predictions. In particular, instead of choosing one final model over a list of candidate models which ignores model uncertainty, we propose to suitably combine predictions from all considered models using Bayesian model averaging.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods have been developed for the analysis of longitunal data in neurodegenerative diseases. To cope with the lack of temporal markers - i.e. to account for subject-specific disease progression in regard to age - a common strategy consists in realigning the individual sequence data in time. Patient's specific trajectories can indeed be seen as spatiotemporal perturbations of the same normative disease trajectory. However, these models do not easily allow one to account for multimodal data, which more than often include missing values. Indeed, it is rare that imaging and clinical examinations for instance are performed at the same frequency in clinical protocols. Multimodal models also need to allow a different profile of progression for data with different structure and representation.We propose to use a generative mixed effect model that considers the progression trajectories as curves on a Riemannian Manifold. We use the concept of product manifold to handle multimodal data, and leverage the generative aspect of our model to handle missing values. We assess the robusteness of our methods toward missing values frequency on both synthetic and real data. Finally we apply our model on a real-world dataset to model Parkinson's disease progression from data derived from clinical examination and imaging.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study is to determine the shape of the progression curve in ALS, assess the impact of clinical variables on the rate of progression, and evaluate the association between functional decline and survival. Data were prospectively collected and entered into a clinical database from all patients seen in 2002-2008 at the Centre SLA, Hôpital de la Salpêtrière, Paris. Variables analyzed were demographic and baseline information, the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), strength testing (MMT), and survival. Generalized additive mixed models characterized changes in ALSFRS-R and MMT scores over time. Linear mixed effects assessed the impact of demographic and clinical measures on rate of progression and Cox models examined their effect on survival. Of 2,452 patients with ALS identified, 1,884 had adequate data for analysis. The ALSFRS-R and MMT declined in a curvilinear way; a quadratic fit described the trends but a linear fit did not. The total ALSFRS-R score was negatively associated with age-of-onset (p {\textless} 0.001), and positively associated with baseline ALSFRS-R (p {\textless} 0.001) as well as more severe bulbar features (p {\textless} 0.001). Higher rate of decline in ALSFRS-R and MMT, older age-at-onset and bulbar-onset predicted shorter survival. Deterioration in ALS is non-linear. The early and late phases of the illness show the most rapid rates of decline. Older age and bulbar signs are associated with a steeper decline, and along with more rapid initial rate of decline, but not current functional status, also predict survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most frequent small artery brain disease caused by pathogenic variants of the NOTCH3 gene. During the disease, we still do not know how the various deficits progress and develop with each other at different stages of the disease. We aim to model disease progression and identify possible progressive subgroups and the effects of different covariates on clinical worsening.
METHODS: Data were obtained from patients followed in the French CADASIL referral center, who were aged 25-80 years and had completed at least 2 visits and one of 14 clinical scores. Progression and variability were assessed using a disease course model (Leaspy). A Gaussian mixture model was used to identify different progression subgroups. Logistic regressions were used to compare the characteristics between groups.
RESULTS: In 395 patients along 2,007 visits, the follow-up ranged from 6 months to 19 years, with a mean of 7.5 years. They were 45\% men with a mean age of 52.2 years. The evolution curves of the different scores showed that clinical manifestations develop heterogeneously and can vary considerably depending on the disease stage. We identified an early-onset, rapidly progressing subgroup of patients with earlier motor symptoms and focal neurologic deficits (median time shift 59 [Q1-Q3 48.9-66.3], median acceleration rate 0.84 [0.07-1.31]) and a late-onset slowly progressing group with earlier cognitive symptoms (median time shift 69.2 [63.4-75.1], median acceleration rate -0.18 [-0.48 to 0.14]). Male sex, lower education level, hypertension, and NOTCH3 pathogenic variant location within epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGFr) 1-6 were found to be associated with this group difference.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest a gradual and heterogeneous decline in different clinical and cognitive performances over the lifetime of patients with CADASIL. Two progression profiles-one rapid and early and the other, more delayed and slower-are possible after the onset of symptoms. A major limitation of our study is that the clusters were assessed post hoc, which may induce some bias. Overall, male sex, low level of education, pathogenic variant location in EGFr 1 to 6 domains, smoking, and/or arterial hypertension may affect the clinical progression of the disease.},

The variability in the dynamics of changes in both brain images and cognitive impairments remains poorly understood. This paper introduces AD Course Map a spatiotemporal atlas of Alzheimer's disease progression. It summarizes the variability in the progression of a series of neuropsychological assessments, the propagation of hypometabolism and cortical thinning across brain regions and the deformation of the shape of the hippocampus. The analysis of these variations highlights strong genetic determinants for the progression, like possible compensatory mechanisms at play during disease progression. AD Course Map also predicts the patient's cognitive decline with a better accuracy than the 56 methods benchmarked in the open challenge TADPOLE. Finally, AD Course Map is used to simulate cohorts of virtual patients developing Alzheimer's disease. AD Course Map offers therefore new tools for exploring the progression of AD and personalizing patients care.},

Identifying the persons who will experience significant progression in the short term is key for the implementation of trials with smaller sample sizes. We apply here disease course mapping to forecast biomarker progression for individual carriers of the pathological CAG repeat expansions responsible for Huntington disease. We used data from two longitudinal studies (TRACK-HD and TRACK-ON) to synchronize temporal progression of 15 clinical and imaging biomarkers from 290 participants with Huntington disease. We used then the resulting HD COURSE MAP to forecast clinical endpoints from the baseline data of 11,510 participants from ENROLL-HD, an external validation cohort. We used such forecasts to select participants at risk for progression and compute the power of trials for such an enriched population. HD COURSE MAP forecasts biomarkers 5 years after the baseline measures with a maximum mean absolute error of 10 points for the total motor score and 2.15 for the total functional capacity. This allowed reducing sample sizes in trial up to 50\% including participants with a higher risk for progression ensuring a more homogeneous group of participants.},

It aims at reconstructing the complex and heterogeneous dynamic of evolution of the structure, the functions and the cognitive abilities of the brain, at both an average and individual level. To do so, we consider a mixed-effects model that, based on longitudinal data, namely repeated observations per subjects that present multiple modalities, in parallel recombines the individual spatiotemporal trajectories into a group-average scenario of change, and, estimates the variability of this characteristic progression which characterizes the individual trajectories. This variability results from a temporal un-alignment (in term of pace of progression and age at disease onset) along with a spatial variability that takes the form of a modification in the sequence of events that appear during the course of the disease. The different parts of the thesis are ordered in a coherent sequence: from the medical problematic, followed by the statistical model introduced to tackle the aforementioned challenge and its application to the description of the course of Alzheimer's disease, and, finally, numerical tools developed to make the previous model available to the medical community.},

We tested the method on more than 96,000 cases, with a pool of more than 4,600 patients from four continents. We measured the accuracy of the method for selecting participants displaying a progression of clinical endpoints during a hypothetical trial. We show that enriching the population with the predicted progressors decreases the required sample size by 38\% to 50\%, depending on trial duration, outcome, and targeted disease stage, from asymptomatic individuals at risk of AD to subjects with early and mild AD. We show that the method introduces no biases regarding sex or geographic locations and is robust to missing data. It performs best at the earliest stages of disease and is therefore highly suitable for use in prevention trials.},

TADPOLE Challenge participants train their models and algorithms on historical data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. Participants are then required to make forecasts of three key outcomes for ADNI-3 rollover participants: clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Subdomain (ADAS-Cog 13), and total volume of the ventricles – which are then compared with future measurements. Strong points of the challenge are that the test data did not exist at the time of forecasting (it was acquired afterwards), and that it focuses on the challenging problem of cohort selection for clinical trials by identifying fast progressors. The submission phase of TADPOLE was open until 15 November 2017; since then data has been acquired until April 2019 from 219 subjects with 223 clinical visits and 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans, which was used for the evaluation of the participants’ predictions. Thirty-three teams participated with a total of 92 submissions. No single submission was best at predicting all three outcomes. For diagnosis prediction, the best forecast (team Frog), which was based on gradient boosting, obtained a multiclass area under the receiver-operating curve (MAUC) of 0.931, while for ventricle prediction the best forecast (team EMC1 ), which was based on disease progression modelling and spline regression, obtained mean absolute error of 0.41\% of total intracranial volume (ICV). For ADAS-Cog 13, no forecast was considerably better than the benchmark mixed effects model (BenchmarkME ), provided to participants before the submission deadline. Further analysis can help understand which input features and algorithms are most suitable for Alzheimer’s disease prediction and for aiding patient stratification in clinical trials.

We performed sample size calculations for therapeutic trials with different scenarios to improve the responsiveness of the scale.
RESULTS: Seven of the eight different items had a nonlinear progression. The speed of progression was different between most of the items, with an average time for a one-point increase from 3.5 years [3.4; 3.6] (median, 95\% credible interval) for the fastest item to 11.4 [10.9; 12.0] years. The total SARA score had a linear progression with an average time for a one-point increase of 0.95 [0.92; 0.98] years. After removing the four last items and rescaling all items from 0 to 4, variability increased and progression was slower and thus would require a larger sample size in a future therapeutic trial.
CONCLUSION: Despite a heterogeneous temporal dynamics at the item level, the global progression of SARA was linear. Changing the initial scale deteriorates the responsiveness. This new information about the temporal dynamics of the scale should help design the outcome of future clinical trials. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies showed the impact of sex and onset site (spinal or bulbar) on disease onset and survival in ALS. However, they mainly result from cross-sectional or survival analysis, and the interaction of sex and onset site on the different proxies of disease trajectory has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: We selected all patients with repeated observations in the PRO-ACT database. We divided them into four groups depending on their sex and onset site. We estimated a multivariate disease progression model, named ALS Course Map, to investigate the combined temporal changes of the four sub-scores of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRSr), the forced vital capacity (FVC), and the body mass index (BMI). We then compared the progression rate, the estimated age at onset, and the relative progression of the outcomes across each group.
RESULTS: We included 1438 patients from the PRO-ACT database. They were 51\% men with spinal onset, 12\% men with bulbar onset, 26\% women with spinal onset, and 11\% women with bulbar onset. We showed a significant influence of both sex and onset site on the ALSFRSr progression. The BMI decreased 8.9 months earlier (95\% CI [3.9, 13.8]) in women than men, after correction for the onset site. Among patients with bulbar onset, FVC was impaired 2.6 months earlier (95\% CI [0.6, 4.6]) in women.
CONCLUSION: Using a multivariable disease modelling approach, we showed that sex and onset site are important drivers of the progression of motor function, BMI, and FVC decline.},

	abstract = {Progression heterogeneity in chronic diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a significant obstacle to developing effective treatments. Leveraging the growing wealth of large databases through modelling can help better understanding it. However, the data collected only offer access to partial trajectories, that need to be realigned to reconstruct a comprehensive disease progression. To address this challenge, data-driven progression models like the longitudinal Spatiotemporal model were developed. Its main interest is its ability to synchronise patients onto a common disease timeline (temporal aspect) thanks to a latent disease age, while also capturing the remaining variability through parameters that account for outcome ordering (spatial aspect). However, this model was primarily designed for longitudinal data, overlooking crucial outcomes in ALS such as time to death or initiation of life support, like Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). Conversely, existing joint models offer the advantage of simultaneously handling longitudinal and survival data. However, they do not realign trajectories, which compromises their temporal resolution. This thesis aimed to expand the Spatiotemporal model into a Joint Spatiotemporal model, enabling, for ALS research, the examination of survival data alongside longitudinal data. First, we applied the Spatiotemporal model to explore how the interaction between sex and onset site (spinal or bulbar) impacts the progression of ALS patients. We selected 1,438 patients from the PRO-ACT database. We demonstrated a significant influence of both sex and onset site on six longitudinal outcomes monitoring the functional and respiratory decline in addition to Body Mass Index. However, this study did not incorporate survival analysis, despite its paramount importance in ALS, due to limitations inherent to the Spatiotemporal model. To address this gap, we associated the Spatiotemporal model with a survival model that estimates a Weibull survival model from its latent disease age, creating a univariate Joint Temporal model. After model validation, we benchmarked our model with a state-of-the-art joint model on PRO-ACT data. Our model exhibited significantly superior performance in terms of absolute bias and mean cumulative AUC for right-censored events. This demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in the context of ALS compared to existing joint models. However, modelling several longitudinal outcomes requires a multivariate approach. Life support initiation that might be censored by death needs to be also considered. We thus extended the Joint Temporal model, into a multivariate Joint Spatiotemporal model with competing risks to analyse NIV initiation. This involved coupling the multivariate Spatiotemporal model with a cause-specific Weibull survival model from the latent disease age. We incorporated spatial parameters with a Cox proportional effect on the hazard. After validation, we benchmarked our model with a state-of-the-art joint model on PRO-ACT data and analysed sex and onset site interaction in complement to the first study. The Joint Spatiotemporal model achieved similar performance to the state-of-the-art model while capturing an underlying shared latent process, the latent disease age, whereas the state-of-the-art models the impact of longitudinal outcomes on survival. To enhance the reproducibility and facilitate the reuse of these models, the proposed models were implemented in the open-source software Leaspy. In conclusion, this thesis introduces the first data-driven progression model combining longitudinal and survival modelling. We demonstrated its relevance to understand the occurrence of critical events in ALS. This work paves the way for further extension to analyse recurrent events, among other potential applications in causal inference.},

	abstract = {Non-terminal events can represent a meaningful change in a patient's life. Thus, better understanding and predicting their occurrence can bring valuable information to individuals. In a context where longitudinal markers could inform these events, joint models with competing risks have been developed. Their precision relies on a reference time for which disease onset is often used. Nevertheless, chronic diseases have no clear onset, making it difficult to define a precise reference time. We propose a Joint cause-specific Spatiotemporal model to overcome this limitation and to capture a shared latent process, a latent age (temporal aspect), associated with the ordering of the longitudinal outcomes (spatial aspect). First, we validated our model on simulated real-like data. Then, we benchmarked our model with a shared-random-effect joint model on real ALS data using the PRO-ACT dataset. Finally, to show how the model could be used for description tasks, we analysed the impact of sex and onset site on the progression of ALS as well as the initiation of Non-Invasive Ventilation. The Joint cause-specific spatiotemporal model achieved similar performance to the shared random effect joint model while capturing the latent disease age and the impact of the ordering of longitudinal outcomes on the occurrence of the events with fewer parameters. The application study confirmed existing results for the Longitudinal outcomes and showed how to interpret the model. The proposed approach by disentangling a temporal and a spatial aspect of the disease opens the perspective to capture meaningful change in future clinical trials.},

Usual approaches use continuous data such as biomarkers to assess progression. Nevertheless, categorical or ordinal data such as item responses in questionnaires also provide insightful information about disease progression. In this work, we propose a disease progression model for ordinal and categorical data. We built it on the principles of disease course mapping, a technique that uniquely describes the variability in both the dynamics of progression and disease heterogeneity from multivariate longitudinal data. This extension can also be seen as an attempt to bridge the gap between longitudinal multivariate models and the field of item response theory. Application to the Parkinson's progression markers initiative cohort illustrates the benefits of our approach: a fine-grained description of disease progression at the item level, as compared to the aggregated total score, together with improved predictions of the patient's future visits. The analysis of the heterogeneity across individual trajectories highlights known disease trends such as tremor dominant or postural instability and gait difficulties subtypes of Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {Prediction-powered inference (PPI) [1] and its subsequent development called PPI++ [2] provide a novel approach to standard statistical estimation leveraging machine learning systems to enhance unlabeled data with predictions. We use this paradigm in clinical trials. The predictions are provided by disease progression models, providing prognostic scores for all the participants as a function of baseline covariates. The proposed method would empower clinical trials by providing untreated digital twins of the treated patients while remaining statistically valid. The potential implications of this new estimator of the treatment effect in a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) are manifold. First, it leads to an overall reduction of the sample size required to reach the same power as a standard RCT. Secondly, it advocates for an imbalance of controls and treated patients, requiring fewer controls to achieve the same power. Finally, this technique directly transfers any disease prediction model trained on large cohorts to practical and scientifically valid use. In this paper, we demonstrate the theoretical properties of this estimator and illustrate them through simulations. We show that it is asymptotically unbiased for the Average Treatment Effect and derive an explicit formula for its variance. An application to an Alzheimer’s disease clinical trial showcases the potential to reduce the sample size.},

 abstract = {Use of the proportional hazards regression model (Cox 1972) substantially liberalized the analysis of censored survival data with covariates. Available procedures for estimation of the relative risk parameter, however, do not adequately handle grouped survival data, or large data sets with many tied failure times. The grouped data version of the proportional hazards model is proposed here for such estimation. Asymptotic likelihood results are given, both for the estimation of the regression coefficient and the survivor function. Some special results are given for testing the hypothesis of a zero regression coefficient which leads, for example, to a generalization of the log-rank test for the comparison of several survival curves. Application to breast cancer data, from the National Cancer Institute-sponsored End Results Group, indicates that previously noted race differences in breast cancer survival times are explained to a large extent by differences in disease extent and other demographic characteristics at diagnosis.},

abstract = {Most statistical developments in the joint modelling area have focused on the shared random-effect models that include characteristics of the longitudinal marker as predictors in the model for the time-to-event. A less well-known approach is the joint latent class model which consists in assuming that a latent class structure entirely captures the correlation between the longitudinal marker trajectory and the risk of the event. Owing to its flexibility in modelling the dependency between the longitudinal marker and the event time, as well as its ability to include covariates, the joint latent class model may be particularly suited for prediction problems. This article aims at giving an overview of joint latent class modelling, especially in the prediction context. The authors introduce the model, discuss estimation and goodness-of-fit, and compare it with the shared random-effect model. Then, dynamic predictive tools derived from joint latent class models, as well as measures to evaluate their dynamic predictive accuracy, are presented. A detailed illustration of the methods is given in the context of the prediction of prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy based on repeated measures of Prostate Specific Antigen.},

The progression is modeled by continuous trajectories in the space of measurements. Individual trajectories of progression result from spatiotemporal transformations of an average trajectory. These transformations allow for the quantification of changes in direction and pace at which the trajectories are followed. The framework of Riemannian geometry allows the model to be used with any kind of measurements with smooth constraints. A stochastic version of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to produce maximum a posteriori estimates of the parameters. We evaluated our method using a series of neuropsychological test scores from patients with mild cognitive impairments, later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, and simulated evolutions of symmetric positive definite matrices. The data-driven model of impairment of cognitive functions illustrated the variability in the ordering and timing of the decline of these functions in the population.
