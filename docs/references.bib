	abstract = {The aim of the study is to determine the shape of the progression curve in ALS, assess the impact of clinical variables on the rate of progression, and evaluate the association between functional decline and survival. Data were prospectively collected and entered into a clinical database from all patients seen in 2002-2008 at the Centre SLA, Hôpital de la Salpêtrière, Paris. Variables analyzed were demographic and baseline information, the ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R), strength testing (MMT), and survival. Generalized additive mixed models characterized changes in ALSFRS-R and MMT scores over time. Linear mixed effects assessed the impact of demographic and clinical measures on rate of progression and Cox models examined their effect on survival. Of 2,452 patients with ALS identified, 1,884 had adequate data for analysis. The ALSFRS-R and MMT declined in a curvilinear way; a quadratic fit described the trends but a linear fit did not. The total ALSFRS-R score was negatively associated with age-of-onset (p {\textless} 0.001), and positively associated with baseline ALSFRS-R (p {\textless} 0.001) as well as more severe bulbar features (p {\textless} 0.001). Higher rate of decline in ALSFRS-R and MMT, older age-at-onset and bulbar-onset predicted shorter survival. Deterioration in ALS is non-linear. The early and late phases of the illness show the most rapid rates of decline. Older age and bulbar signs are associated with a steeper decline, and along with more rapid initial rate of decline, but not current functional status, also predict survival.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most frequent small artery brain disease caused by pathogenic variants of the NOTCH3 gene. During the disease, we still do not know how the various deficits progress and develop with each other at different stages of the disease. We aim to model disease progression and identify possible progressive subgroups and the effects of different covariates on clinical worsening.
METHODS: Data were obtained from patients followed in the French CADASIL referral center, who were aged 25-80 years and had completed at least 2 visits and one of 14 clinical scores. Progression and variability were assessed using a disease course model (Leaspy). A Gaussian mixture model was used to identify different progression subgroups. Logistic regressions were used to compare the characteristics between groups.
RESULTS: In 395 patients along 2,007 visits, the follow-up ranged from 6 months to 19 years, with a mean of 7.5 years. They were 45\% men with a mean age of 52.2 years. The evolution curves of the different scores showed that clinical manifestations develop heterogeneously and can vary considerably depending on the disease stage. We identified an early-onset, rapidly progressing subgroup of patients with earlier motor symptoms and focal neurologic deficits (median time shift 59 [Q1-Q3 48.9-66.3], median acceleration rate 0.84 [0.07-1.31]) and a late-onset slowly progressing group with earlier cognitive symptoms (median time shift 69.2 [63.4-75.1], median acceleration rate -0.18 [-0.48 to 0.14]). Male sex, lower education level, hypertension, and NOTCH3 pathogenic variant location within epidermal growth factor-like repeat (EGFr) 1-6 were found to be associated with this group difference.
DISCUSSION: Our results suggest a gradual and heterogeneous decline in different clinical and cognitive performances over the lifetime of patients with CADASIL. Two progression profiles-one rapid and early and the other, more delayed and slower-are possible after the onset of symptoms. A major limitation of our study is that the clusters were assessed post hoc, which may induce some bias. Overall, male sex, low level of education, pathogenic variant location in EGFr 1 to 6 domains, smoking, and/or arterial hypertension may affect the clinical progression of the disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the progressive alterations seen in brain images which give rise to the onset of various sets of symptoms. The variability in the dynamics of changes in both brain images and cognitive impairments remains poorly understood. This paper introduces AD Course Map a spatiotemporal atlas of Alzheimer's disease progression. It summarizes the variability in the progression of a series of neuropsychological assessments, the propagation of hypometabolism and cortical thinning across brain regions and the deformation of the shape of the hippocampus. The analysis of these variations highlights strong genetic determinants for the progression, like possible compensatory mechanisms at play during disease progression. AD Course Map also predicts the patient's cognitive decline with a better accuracy than the 56 methods benchmarked in the open challenge TADPOLE. Finally, AD Course Map is used to simulate cohorts of virtual patients developing Alzheimer's disease. AD Course Map offers therefore new tools for exploring the progression of AD and personalizing patients care.},

	abstract = {Variability in neurodegenerative disease progression poses great challenges for the evaluation of potential treatments. Identifying the persons who will experience significant progression in the short term is key for the implementation of trials with smaller sample sizes. We apply here disease course mapping to forecast biomarker progression for individual carriers of the pathological CAG repeat expansions responsible for Huntington disease. We used data from two longitudinal studies (TRACK-HD and TRACK-ON) to synchronize temporal progression of 15 clinical and imaging biomarkers from 290 participants with Huntington disease. We used then the resulting HD COURSE MAP to forecast clinical endpoints from the baseline data of 11,510 participants from ENROLL-HD, an external validation cohort. We used such forecasts to select participants at risk for progression and compute the power of trials for such an enriched population. HD COURSE MAP forecasts biomarkers 5 years after the baseline measures with a maximum mean absolute error of 10 points for the total motor score and 2.15 for the total functional capacity. This allowed reducing sample sizes in trial up to 50\% including participants with a higher risk for progression ensuring a more homogeneous group of participants.},

	abstract = {The anticipation of progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is crucial for evaluations of secondary prevention measures thought to modify the disease trajectory. However, it is difficult to forecast the natural progression of AD, notably because several functions decline at different ages and different rates in different patients. We evaluate here AD Course Map, a statistical model predicting the progression of neuropsychological assessments and imaging biomarkers for a patient from current medical and radiological data at early disease stages. We tested the method on more than 96,000 cases, with a pool of more than 4,600 patients from four continents. We measured the accuracy of the method for selecting participants displaying a progression of clinical endpoints during a hypothetical trial. We show that enriching the population with the predicted progressors decreases the required sample size by 38\% to 50\%, depending on trial duration, outcome, and targeted disease stage, from asymptomatic individuals at risk of AD to subjects with early and mild AD. We show that the method introduces no biases regarding sex or geographic locations and is robust to missing data. It performs best at the earliest stages of disease and is therefore highly suitable for use in prevention trials.},

	doi = {10.1002/mds.29255},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) is the reference clinical scale to assess the severity of cerebellar ataxia. In the context of upcoming therapeutic trials, a reliable clinical outcome is needed to assess the efficiency of treatments.
OBJECTIVE: The aim is to precisely assess and compare temporal dynamics of SARA and a new f-SARA.
METHODS: We analyzed data from four cohorts (EUROSCA, RISCA, CRC-SCA, and SPATAX) comprising 1210 participants and 4092 visits. The linearity of the progression and the variability were assessed using an ordinal Bayesian mixed-effect model (Leaspy). We performed sample size calculations for therapeutic trials with different scenarios to improve the responsiveness of the scale.
RESULTS: Seven of the eight different items had a nonlinear progression. The speed of progression was different between most of the items, with an average time for a one-point increase from 3.5 years [3.4; 3.6] (median, 95\% credible interval) for the fastest item to 11.4 [10.9; 12.0] years. The total SARA score had a linear progression with an average time for a one-point increase of 0.95 [0.92; 0.98] years. After removing the four last items and rescaling all items from 0 to 4, variability increased and progression was slower and thus would require a larger sample size in a future therapeutic trial.
CONCLUSION: Despite a heterogeneous temporal dynamics at the item level, the global progression of SARA was linear. Changing the initial scale deteriorates the responsiveness. This new information about the temporal dynamics of the scale should help design the outcome of future clinical trials. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies showed the impact of sex and onset site (spinal or bulbar) on disease onset and survival in ALS. However, they mainly result from cross-sectional or survival analysis, and the interaction of sex and onset site on the different proxies of disease trajectory has not been fully investigated.
METHODS: We selected all patients with repeated observations in the PRO-ACT database. We divided them into four groups depending on their sex and onset site. We estimated a multivariate disease progression model, named ALS Course Map, to investigate the combined temporal changes of the four sub-scores of the revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRSr), the forced vital capacity (FVC), and the body mass index (BMI). We then compared the progression rate, the estimated age at onset, and the relative progression of the outcomes across each group.
RESULTS: We included 1438 patients from the PRO-ACT database. They were 51\% men with spinal onset, 12\% men with bulbar onset, 26\% women with spinal onset, and 11\% women with bulbar onset. We showed a significant influence of both sex and onset site on the ALSFRSr progression. The BMI decreased 8.9 months earlier (95\% CI [3.9, 13.8]) in women than men, after correction for the onset site. Among patients with bulbar onset, FVC was impaired 2.6 months earlier (95\% CI [0.6, 4.6]) in women.
CONCLUSION: Using a multivariable disease modelling approach, we showed that sex and onset site are important drivers of the progression of motor function, BMI, and FVC decline.},
