This section describes the procedure for simulating new patient data under the Spatiotemporal model structure. The simulation method, relying on a fitted Leaspy model and user-defined parameters, involves the following steps:

**Step 1: Generation of Individual Parameters** <br>
For each simulated patient, individual parameters ($\tau_i$, $\xi_i$, and the sources) are sampled from normal distributions defined by the modelâ€™s mean and standard deviation:<br>
- $\xi_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \sigma^2_{\xi}\right)$,
- $\tau_i \sim \mathcal{N}\left(t_0, \sigma^2_{\tau}\right)$,
- $N_s \text{ sources } s_{i,m} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\bar{s}, \sigma_s\right)$

These model parameters come from a previously fitted Leaspy model, provided by the user. 

**Step 2: Generation of Visit Times** <br>
Visit times are generated based on user-specified visit parameters, such as the number of visits, spacing between visits, and follow-up duration. These parameters are provided through a dictionary.

**Step 3: Estimation of Observations** <br>
The estimate function from Leaspy is used to compute the patients observation at the generated visit time $t_{i,j,k}$, based on the individual parameters:<br>
$$
y_{i,j,k} = \gamma_{i,k}(t_{i,j,k}) + \epsilon_{i,j,k}, \quad \epsilon_{i,j,k} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_k)
$$

To reflect variability in the observations, beta-distributed noise is added, appropriate for modeling outcomes in a logistic framework.

### Prerequisites
To run a simulation, the following variables are required:
- A fitted Leaspy model (see the `fit` function), used for both parameter sampling (step 1) and the estimate function (step 3).
- A dictionary of visit parameters, specifying the number, type, and timing of visits (used in step 2).
- An `AlgorithmSettings` object, configured for simulation and including:
  - The name of the features to simulate.
  - The visit parameter dictionary.

### Running the Task

```python
>>> from leaspy.algo import AlgorithmSettings
>>> visits_params = {
        'patient_nb': 200,
        'visit_type': "regular",
        'regular_visit': 1,
        'first_visit_mean': 0.,
        'first_visit_std': 0.4,
        'time_follow_up_mean': 11,
        'time_follow_up_std': 0.5,
        'distance_visit_mean': 2 / 12,
        'distance_visit_std': 0.75 / 12,
    }
>>> simulated_data = model.simulate( 
         algorithm="simulate", 
         features=["MDS1_total", "MDS2_total", "MDS3_off_total"],
         visit_parameters= visits_params
    )
Simulate with `simulation` took: 3s
>>> print(simulated_data.data.to_dataframe().set_index(['ID', 'TIME']).head())
              MDS1_total   MDS2_total   MDS3_total
ID     TIME
 0   48.092     0.113991     0.344018     0.228870
     49.092     0.177138     0.291440     0.332267
     50.092     0.256084     0.253093     0.314241
     51.092     0.174059     0.344921     0.313776
     52.092     0.245289     0.400363     0.310065
```

### Output

The output is a Data object with ID, TIME and simulated values of each feature. 

### Setting options

There are three options to simulate the visit times in Leaspy, which can be specified in visit_param dictionary: 
- `random`: Visit times and intervals are sampled from normal distributions.
- `regular`: Visits occur at regular intervals, defined by regular_visit. 
- `dataframe`: Custom visit times are provided directly via a DataFrame.

Refer to the docstring for further details.
